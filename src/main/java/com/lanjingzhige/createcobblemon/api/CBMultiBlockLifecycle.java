/**
 * Shared lifecycle plumbing for blocks whose single logical machine occupies more

 * <p>The contract mirrors vanilla doors and beds plus Create's large water wheel:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only the anchor part has a loot table entry, every other part drops nothing,
 * and no code path pops the block item itself. Creative mode, explosions and
 * third-party {@code destroyBlock(pos, false)} calls then behave the way the engine
 * intends instead of each needing its own special case.</li>
 * <li>Structure validation never runs from {@code updateShape}. Neighbour changes
 * only schedule a block tick, which collapses a burst of updates into a single
 * check, keeps the check off the client, and makes reentrancy guards unnecessary
 * because scheduled ticks never fire on a position that has already been cleared.</li>
 * <li>Positions in unloaded chunks count as intact, so a structure straddling a
 * chunk border is neither torn down nor allowed to force its neighbour in from disk
 * just because a block update happened at the edge of the loaded area.</li>
 * </ul>
